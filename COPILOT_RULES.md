This project is intentionally minimal.

DO NOT:

- Add authentication
- Add user accounts
- Add animations or transitions
- Add design systems
- Add abstractions
- Add extra endpoints
- Add extra features “for later”

ALWAYS:

- Prefer simple, readable code over clever code
- Keep files small and flat
- Follow existing patterns exactly
- Ask for nothing; assume scope is frozen

If unsure, choose the simplest possible solution.
